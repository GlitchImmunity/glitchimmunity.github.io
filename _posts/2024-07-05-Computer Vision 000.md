Welcome to my introduction post to my series on computer vision algorithms and applications. This series will go over the general theory behind many computer vision algorithms, as well as example demos on how to use these algorithms in practice. All code will be linked at the end in a Python Notebook, which can be tested in Google Colab. I am also planning on building a github repo for all of these algorithms and demos, so stay tuned for that in the future!
